Dude, I just finished watching A Working Man, and wow, like, idk how I feel about it. It was, you know, kinda intense and super real. Honestly, it hit a bit hard. I mean like, who knew a film about factory life could make you feel all kinds of ways? Felt like a documentary at points. And man, the main guy, he's all about that grind, right? But also, so quiet. Like he's living a whole universe in his head. Weirdly inspiring but also kinda sad. Not sure I'd download the movie to watch it again anytime soon, lol.

> The colors, though, so drab but somehow fitting? Like, they nailed the vibe of it being monotonous and heavy but still... IDK, had moments of light? I'm not even sure what I'm saying, haha. Maybe I should try to watch the movie again or something. If you watch it, pay attention to the scene where he's just staring at the machines humming away. Felt like it stretched on forever but in a good way? Levels of zen I can't even handle.

Seriously though, the whole labor struggle message? Bro, that's like, the anthem for everyone just hustling to get by, except they don't sugarcoat it. Kinda made me think about my own 9 to 5 and whether I need a new hobby or something. The fact that this movie doesn't have loads of dialogue but I still felt its message, like slap-in-your-face style. That's good storytelling right there. Even if watching silently working machines isn't everyone's idea of fun, it's hard to look away, ya know?

Also, side note â€“ I didn't cry, you cried. ðŸ˜‚ Just sayin'. There's this bit where he's all alone in the cafeteria, and it just hit different. Can't even explain why. The dude's soul is in sad solitude and you're just there watching it unfold.

string randomLine = For no reason, I can't even with this part;

Anyway, I'll shut up now cuz I'm rambling. Go watch it, then tell me what you think. Might need to digest this one over some beers, tbh. Catch ya later, man.
